These include soft skills such as having empathy for others, creating positive interpersonal communications, using problem-solving, and exemplifying change agility. I think the assets that have allowed me to be both a successful student in school and an achiever in the workforce is my well-rounded work ethic, my organization skills, my time management, and my ability to easily collaborate with others. With these skills along with the web development skills I have attained in my coding bootcamp, I am hoping to find a job as a junior or mid-level web developer. I want to further the knowledge I have in web design and development and become a positive, eager addition to a web development team.")
